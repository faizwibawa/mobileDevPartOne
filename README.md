# 📱 MobileDevPartOne – Android Assignment #1

Welcome to my first mobile development assignment!  
This project is built using **Jetpack Compose** in **Android Studio**, and it showcases a simple yet structured UI layout inspired by a Figma design.

---

## 🎯 Project Description

This is a static UI screen coded entirely in **Jetpack Compose**, based on a mobile prototype created in **Figma**. It simulates a home screen layout with custom-styled buttons, text elements, and vector-based icons.

> The layout was directly adapted from design-to-code using a plugin export, then cleaned and debugged to run on an actual Android environment.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `MainActivity.kt` – Entry point of the app
- `AllLayout.kt` – The full Compose UI layout
- `ui.theme/` – Theme and color palette definitions
- `res/drawable/` – Custom icons and visual assets

## 🖼️ Preview
